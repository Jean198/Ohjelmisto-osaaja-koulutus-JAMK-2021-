    The console.log calls outside the functions will be executed first because they are in the call stack. After that console.log in print function will be executed.

    This is because the function "execute" is calling the function "print" which also uses "setTimeout" function. This will place it in the callback queue
    and wait for programs in the call stack to be executed first. Also the 2s and 0.5s timeout make a difference. 0.5s timeout will be executed first.

    If we wouldnt have "setTimeout" function in the program, all the programs would be executed in the order they are in.
